# Market-Segmentation-using-KMeans-Clustering
This is a simple Market Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering. The dataset is based on the customer's satisfaction and loyalty 
to determine different clusters that can be obtained from that data. Finally, we can find the traits of customer segments by analyzing 
the characteristics of the clusters.

I'm standardizing the data using scaler to make sure that KMeans cluster them based on the features equally
I also used Elbow Method to determine the optimum number of clusters.
